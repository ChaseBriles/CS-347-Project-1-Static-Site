	<h2>Early Life</h2>
	<p> Warren Buffett was born on August 30, 1930, during the beginning of the Great Depression. Buffett was entrepreneurial at a young age. After his first income tax return at age 14, he built up a pinball business which was sold for $1,200 (roughly $15,268 in 2021). Due to his early success, Buffett did not want to attend college. Buffett's father disagreed with these thoughts, which led Buffett to finishing his Bachelor of Science in Business Administration from University of Nebraska at age 19. Age 19 was also the important point where Buffett purchased "The Intelligent Investor" by Benjamin Graham. "The Intelligent Investor" impressed Buffett so much that he sought out Benjamin Graham and became his student at Columbia University in the Master of Science in Economics program. </p>
	<h2>Early/Middle Business</h2>

	<p> After Buffett finished his Master of Science in Economics in 1951, Buffett offered to work for Graham for free, but he was denied with Graham saying "You're overpriced." In result, Buffett became an investment salesman from 1951 to 1954 before eventually starting his work with Graham from 1954 to 1956. In 1956, Buffett started his own investment partnership which led to Buffett taking over a failing textile manufacturing firm, Berkshire Hathaway, in 1965, later saying it was the worst deal he made. </p>
	<h2>Middle/Late Business</h2>

	<p> The core business of Berkshire Hathaway was sold, but Buffett kept the name and continued to expand operations to various industries. Although Buffett stuck to Graham's teachings for many years, he eventually transformed his investment philosophy after his bad experience with Berkshire Hathaway. Instead of focusing solely on cheap, undervalued companies, Buffett began to seek out fair valued companies that had bright prospects. This philosophy change allowed Buffett to grow Berkshire Hathaway, a failed textile manufacturer, into a multinational conglomerate holding company, which now wholly owns GEICO, DuraCell, Dairy Queen, BNSF, Fruit of the Loom, and has large holdings in other household names including the Coca-Cola company and Apple. Buffett was largely able to do this because he had an optimistic outlook on America throughout all of the economic downturns, which led him to purchase undervalued businesses after they collapsed in price during the downturns. </p>

	<p> Buffett is not only popular due to his business success. Buffett also has a reputation for being a good person. Buffett purchased his house in 1957 for $31,500, where he still lives today. Despite being one of the richest people in the world, Buffett still uses coupons to save money when he goes shopping. Buffett does not live a flashy lifestyle, indicating his success was largely due to enjoying his work. Buffett also enjoys spreading his knowledge through shareholder letters and annual meetings, colleges, and news interviews. Buffett is an advocate for higher taxes for the rich, and he has pledged over 99% of his net worth will go to philanthropy. </p>
