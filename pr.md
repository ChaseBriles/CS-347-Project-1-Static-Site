Chase Briles Peer Review

1.What did you like about this website?
I liked the sites simplicity; a lot of sites can be bogged down in a bunch of filler and can be very distracting to the information thatâ€™s on the site. 

2.Describe one significant difference between your own P1 site and this person's
The biggest significance about my site and Kory's is I had a lot of differnt bars and headers in mine like a title bar and a bar for the nav links.
  1. I felt like my site had a better user experience just cause it was a little bit easier on the eyes, the geen and white combo became a little exhaustive after a while.
  2. Kory's codebase is much better overall. My code base can get very jumbled and a bit confusing at parts while Korys is really simple with good amount of white space to see
  whats exactly happening and different parts of the webpage.
  
3.The code was really well structured everything was in easy to identify folders. The code was well structured there were a few points were the CSS was more specifc to one page
than the whole site at times though.

4.Overall I didn't find any major issues like resizing or anything like that. I felt at times there could have been a better alignment with some of the headers and the form. 
  1. all elements were semantically appropriate, I wasn't sure what the figures were but, I think thats cause I haven't seen those before.
  2. CSS was refactored well, some parts I felt like it could be in its own file for the more page specific code but, that might just be a taste differnce.
  
5. I felt like the site needed a little bit more eye catching elements too it. I felt it fell a little bit flat and was a big floaty with the pictures on the sides. Overall though
I really enjoyed the website and learning about Warren Buffet. I really like the green too, I thought that was a really cool color to use.
